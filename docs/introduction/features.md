# Features

Auto Engineer provides a set of tools to automate and streamline the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Below are its core features:

- **Flow Modeling DSL**: Define application behavior using a type-safe, high-level flow model that specifies both frontend and server requirements.
- **Information Architecture Generation**: Automatically generate information architecture schemas to guide application scaffolding.
- **Deterministic Scaffolding**: Produce complete application scaffolds from flow models, including placeholders with implementation hints.
- **AI-Powered Code Implementation**: Use AI agents to implement server and frontend code, guided by precise prompts and deterministic tests.
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Run type checking, linting, test suites, and AI-powered visual testing to ensure production-ready code.
- **Modular Plugin System**: Install only the plugins needed for specific functionality, such as server generation or frontend scaffolding.
- **Event-Driven Message Bus**: Monitor commands and events in real-time via a web dashboard at `http://localhost:5555`.
- **TypeScript Support**: Full TypeScript integration with strict typing for robust development.
- **File Synchronization**: Automatic file watching and syncing for efficient development workflows.

For a detailed explanation of how these features work together, see the Auto Engineer Pipeline.
