# Overview

Auto Engineer is a tool designed to automate the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) by enabling developers to build production-grade applications using a combination of human input and AI-driven agents. It leverages a plugin-based architecture to generate and implement code for both server and frontend components, streamlining the development process from high-level flow modeling to quality-checked production code.

## Key Features

- **Flow Modeling**: Define system behavior using a domain-specific language (DSL) for commands, queries, and reactions.
- **AI-Driven Implementation**: Automate code generation and implementation with AI agents guided by schemas and tests.
- **Plugin System**: Modular architecture allows developers to install only the plugins needed for their use case.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Supports loosely coupled components communicating via events.
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Includes type checking, linting, and AI-powered visual testing to ensure code quality.

Auto Engineer is in early preview and is actively being tested with real-world clients and use cases. Developers can stay updated by joining the Discord community or starring the repository on GitHub.
