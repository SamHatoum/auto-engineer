# Auto Engineer Pipeline

Auto Engineer automates the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) through a pipeline of agentic and procedural modules. The pipeline transforms high-level flow models into production-ready code through the following stages:

1. **Flow Modeling**Define system behavior using a domain-specific language (DSL) that specifies commands, queries, and reactions for both frontend and server components. This step captures the core design of the application.

2. **Information Architecture Generation**An AI-driven information architect generates a schema from the flow model, similar to creating UX wireframes.

3. **Deterministic Scaffolding**The information architecture schema is used to generate a complete application scaffold with placeholders and implementation hints.

4. **Spec-Driven Precision**The scaffold includes prompts and deterministic tests generated from the flow model to guide AI implementation.

5. **AI Coding and Testing Loop**An AI agent implements the code based on the prompts and context. Tests are run, and if they fail, the AI receives error feedback and self-corrects, typically within 1-3 attempts.

6. **Comprehensive Quality Checks**After passing tests, the code undergoes type checking, linting, runtime validation, and AI-powered visual testing to ensure compliance with the design system.

This pipeline ensures that high-level designs are systematically transformed into robust, production-grade applications. For more details on flow modeling, see Building a Flow.
