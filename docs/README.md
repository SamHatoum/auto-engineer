# Auto Engineer Documentation

Auto Engineer puts your SDLC on auto, helping you build **production-grade applications** with the power of **humans + AI-driven agents**.

## Overview

Auto Engineer is a developer tool designed to **automate the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** by combining human input with **AI-powered agents**.

It enables developers to:

- Define **high-level system behavior** using models.
- Automatically **generate, scaffold, and implement code**.
- Build robust frontend and backend components faster.
- Streamline the entire workflow from **design to production**.

By leveraging a **plugin-based architecture**, Auto Engineer adapts to different projects, enabling you to install only the components you need.

Auto Engineer provides a **comprehensive toolkit** for automating modern application development.

### Core Capabilities

- **Flow Modeling DSL** â€“ Define app behavior using a type-safe, high-level modeling language.
- **AI-Powered Code Implementation** â€“ Generate server and frontend code using intelligent AI agents.
- **Deterministic Scaffolding** â€“ Produce complete, predictable application scaffolds from your flow models.
- **Information Architecture Generation** â€“ Automatically create schemas and structure for your app.
- **Event-Driven Architecture** â€“ Build loosely coupled components communicating via events.
- **Comprehensive Validation** â€“ Includes type checking, linting, automated tests, and AI-powered visual validation.
- **Modular Plugin System** â€“ Install only what you need (e.g., server, frontend, integrations).
- **Real-Time Monitoring** â€“ Watch commands and events live via a web dashboard at `http://localhost:5555`.
- **TypeScript First** â€“ Fully integrated with strict typing for safer, more robust development.
- **File Synchronization** â€“ Automatically watch, sync, and regenerate files as you iterate.
