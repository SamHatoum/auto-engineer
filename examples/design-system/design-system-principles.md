Branding & Visual Identity:

- You must **infer the branding** (tone, visual identity, personality) directly from the TailwindCSS + shadcn theme in `src/globals.css`.
- Use the brand's tone and color palette consistently across all components, spacing, interactions, and layout structure.
- Avoid visual indicators like H1/H2 headings — do not use them to represent concepts or sections.
- Communicate page hierarchy through layout, spacing, color intensity, and component usage — **not headings**.

Design Patterns:

- Layouts must be responsive by default.
- Use a consistent spacing scale: 4 / 8 / 12 / 16 px.
- Components must reflect brand personality: minimal, bold, playful, formal, etc., as inferred from the theme.
- Component files should be small and composable.

UX Principles:

- Do not use visual headers or hero titles to convey page identity.
- Use dynamic hierarchy expressed through tone, spacing, and primary-color signals.
- Prefer subtle transitions and clear focus indicators.
