/**
* ## IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS ##

* Define the shape of your domain state below. This state should only include
* values that are used to make decisions in command handlers (decide.ts).
*
* You should:
* - Add only fields that are **read** during command validation
* - Avoid adding fields that are only useful for projections or queries
* - Prefer primitive types (string, number, boolean, etc.) unless structure is required
* - Use optional fields if values are derived incrementally from multiple events
*
* Do NOT include:
* - Redundant data already stored in events unless needed for logic
* - Any state that is not referenced in business rules
